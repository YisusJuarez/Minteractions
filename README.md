### CSS only
You can download the compiled CSS [Minteracions.css](https://github.com/YisusJuarez/Minteractions/blob/master/css/minteractions.css)
You can either use that file, "out of the box", or download the Sass source files to customize the [variables](https://github.com/YisusJuarez/Minteractions/blob/master/sass/basics/_vars.scss)
There is **no** JavaScript included so you are free to develop the functions by yourself.
